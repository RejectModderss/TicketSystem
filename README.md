# TicketSystem
Discord Ticket System made in Discord.py

I made this ticket system for fun, I also wanted to give back to people who just wanna know how to make one.
To run this make sure to run main.py replace everything in the bot so you get 0 errors.

# NOTE:
Anything that says channelid or roleid or has numbers replace them with your channel/role id. I did that so you can see where they go. Anything with numbers will most likely be an ID to something that you need to change to yours!

# NOTE 2: 
Anything that says allowed channels or something, change it how you would like, just make sure you change everything correclty in the buttons too! If you have errors you can add me on discord.
