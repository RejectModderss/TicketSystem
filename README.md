# TicketSystem
Discord Ticket System made in Discord.py

I made this ticket system for fun, I also wanted to give back to people who just wanna know how to make one.

# NOTE:
Anything that says channelid or roleid or has numbers replace them with your channel/role id. I did that so you can see where they go. Anything with numbers will most likely be an ID to something that you need to change to yours!
