# Discord Ticket System

Welcome to the Discord Ticket System, a simple and customizable ticketing solution built using Discord.py.

## Overview

I developed this ticket system for both fun and to provide a helpful resource for those interested in creating their own ticketing systems. Feel free to use and modify it according to your needs. To run the system, make sure to run `main.py` and replace any placeholders with your specific channel and role IDs.

## Important Notes

1. **ID Replacements:** Throughout the code, you'll find placeholders like `channelid` or `roleid` with corresponding numbers. Replace these placeholders with your actual channel or role IDs.

2. **Customization:** Feel free to customize the system according to your preferences. If you encounter any errors or need assistance, you can reach out to me on Discord.
